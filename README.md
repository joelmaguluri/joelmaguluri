## Hi there, I'm Sudeep Joel ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

As a Full Stack Web Developer, I have extensive experience building responsive and dynamic web applications using a variety of technologies. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Information Technology from Arizona State University. I also hold a Post Graduate Diploma in Artificial Intelligence from Purdue University and Simplilearn, as well as a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

### Work Experience

- Full Stack Developer at Cartedo (Remote) from February 2021 to July 2022
- Graduate Teaching Assistant at Arizona State University (Tempe, Arizona) from January 2023 to present
- Full Stack Developer at Wisedoc (Remote) from January 2020 to May 2020

### Projects

Here are some of my relevant projects:

- Classification of Zebra Sub Species: Implemented image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks and VGG NET with Keras package. Achieved a maximum accuracy of 85% with transfer learning on VGG net.
- Next Word Prediction: Built a prediction system that uses CBOW and LSTM with SoftMax activation. Achieved a test accuracy of 82% after training the model for 1200 epochs.
- Twitter Hate Speech Detection: Used RNN with TF-IDF vectors to obtain 97% recall and 98% accuracy for detecting hate speech on Twitter.
- Credit Card Fraud Detection: Addressed class imbalance by generating samples with SMOTE variants, CVAE, and GAN to improve model performance. Achieved a recall of 98% and F1 score of 93% using scikit-learn package, placing among the top 10% of Kaggle submissions.
- Machine Translation of English to Telugu: Developed a word-based sequence-to-sequence model with a 3-layer encoder-decoder architecture using TensorFlow and Keras packages. Achieved a BLEU score of 28.3 with reasonable semantic translation.

### Skills

Here are some of the programming skills and software expertise that I have:

- Languages and frameworks: Python, Java, C, Node JS, Scala, React JS, Tensorflow, Keras, pandas, scikit-learn, Spark, Tableau, Jupyter Notebooks, Oracle, JavaScript, SQL
- Tools & Databases: SQL, PostgresSQL, MongoDB, Postman, Docker, Weka
